# This script sits on an Nginx server, and is run by remote Apache/Nginx
# or app servers to register themselves in a cluster with Nginx. We are using
# this on EC2, to let web/php servers register with the Nginx load balancer.

# Assumes nginx.conf has an upstream default in the config like so:
# upstream default { include /etc/nginx/default.upstream; }
# This file is simply a list of hostnames.
# You may include other upstream files, in the form:
# upstream cluster_name { include /etc/nginx/cluster_name.upstream; }

# Usage: python register-nginx.py [-d/--deregister] client_hostname [cluster_name]

# By the way, I know this is UGLY. But it was quick and dirty. Some day, I might
# fix it.
